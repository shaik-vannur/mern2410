    <p>The<strong> U.S.</strong> Armed Forces are one of the<mark> world's largest military forces in terms of personnel.</mark> 
        They draw their personnel from a large pool of professional volunteers. The U.S.
         has used military conscription, but not <del>since 1973.</del>
         <ins>The Selective Service System retains the power to conscript males</ins>,
          requiring the registration of all male citizens and residents living in the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 25.</p>
          <p>These forces demobilized in 1784 after the Treaty of Paris ended the Revolutionary War. The Congress of the Confederation created the current United States Army on 3 June 1784.[24] The United States Congress created the current United States Navy on 27 March 1794 and the current United States Marine Corps on 11 July 1798.[25][27] All three services trace their origins to their respective Continental predecessors. The 1787 adoption of the Constitution gave Congress the power to "raise and support armies," to "provide and maintain a navy", and to "make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces", as well as the power to declare war. The President of the United States is the United States Armed Forces' commander-in-chief.[28]

            The United States Coast Guard traces its origin to the formation of the Revenue Cutter Service on 4 August 1790, which merged with the United States Life-Saving Service on 28 January 1915 to establish the Coast Guard.[29][30] The United States Air Force was established as an independent service on 18 September 1947; it traces its origin to the formation of the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, which was formed 1 August 1907 and was part of the Army Air Forces before being recognized as an independent service in the National Security Act of 1947.[31] The United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps was formerly considered to be a branch of the United States Armed Forces from 29 July 1945 until 3 July 1952, and is now one of the eight uniformed services of the United States.[32] Should it be called into active duty again, it would constitute a seventh branch of the Armed Forces.[33]</p>
